= Carousel Test =

Using node v10.13.0

    npm start

starts up a dev server showing the application on http://localhost:1234/

    npm test

runs unit tests. I've concentrated on only unit testing the Carousel React component itself.

I've taken a mobile-first approach. Using React to manage the state of what is shown.

Next steps (given more time):

- increase code coverage
- better carousel navigation by keyboard
- transition animations
